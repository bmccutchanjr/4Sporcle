The maximum Sporcle grid size is 30x30  That's a maximum 30 characters per line (including spaces and punctuation).
I want a border, so really 28.

Both the encrypted text and solution must be provided.  The solution should be the the row immediately above
the encrypted text, like:

	"	T	h	e		t	i	m	e		h	a	s		c	o	m	e	,	"		t	h	e
	"	V	T	K	 	V	N	U	K	 	T	J	E	 	W	R	U	K	,	"	 	V	T	K

There is a maximum of one character in each cell.

The quiz has to include both the spaces for solving as well as the encrypted text.  For playability, the solution
cells should appear immediately above the encrypted text.  So that's two actual lines of quiz for each line of
encrypted text.  I'd like a blank row between these pairs and the next, so really three rows.

	"	T	h	e		t	i	m	e		h	a	s		c	o	m	e	,	"		t	h	e
	"	V	T	K	 	V	N	U	K	 	T	J	E	 	W	R	U	K	,	"	 	V	T	K
																							
	w	a	l	r	u	s		s	a	i	d	,		"	t	o		t	a	l	k	 	o	f
	D	J	I	C	X	E	 	E	J	N	L	,		"	V	R	 	V	J	I	Y	 	R	Z

That means a maximum 10 rows of encrypted text, and a maximum 300 characters (preferably 280) in the puzzle.
Longer quotes will not work within the constraints of the Sporcle Grid quiz, but might work as a Map quiz.  Putting
a row of blank cells below the last row of encrypted text takes away one row of encrypted text, which places the
maximum length of the quote at 252 to 270 characters.  (You can go higher, it just won't look as good.)

Rows are terminated with a carriage return.  Cells within a row are separated with tabs.  Blank cells still
require the tab character.  A completely blank row just requires the carriage return.
